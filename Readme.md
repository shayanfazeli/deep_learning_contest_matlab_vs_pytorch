# Deep Learning Contest: A Timing Comparison for Building and Training Neural Networks with MATLAB and Python


To run the matlab (octave) implementation, use the `driver.m` file.

For PyTorch implementation, run the `pynet.py`. (For mutli-threaded usage, change the number of threads used by torch in the beginning of the file.
